# vscode-cmake-hello
Simple project to build a program and library in VSCode using CMake. Testing using GoogleTest is included.

CMake is the defacto standard for build systems. It is supported by every IDE that supports C++.
This repository contains the code that was developed in a set of five articles that I wrote about
using "Modern" CMake and Visual Studio Code to create a simple C++ library and application. The
project is further enhanced to create unit tests using Google Test. CMake files are created to
download and build Google Test and to integrate it into the project.
